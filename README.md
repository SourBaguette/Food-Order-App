This web application is made using the React JS framework for the frontend and Node JS for the backend. 
You can add items to the cart, remove them, go to checkout and place an order (don't worry, you won't have to pay).

The frontend can be run locally using: npm run dev

The backend server can be run using the following steps:
1. cd backend
2. node app

This is how it look like:
